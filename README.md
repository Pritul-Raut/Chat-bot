# Chat-bot
I tried making a chatbot that can speak or chat .
So I used an Open-AI's text-davinci-003  model  by accessing an API KEY which I claim as a signing bonus on a new account opening on Open AI.
To make it more Interactive added some features like playing music, telling me time, greeting me, using Wikipedia tell me, etc., 
I did this with the help of different libraries and obviously with help of you tube 
just pull the code and enter your API key in code and let's have some fun.
